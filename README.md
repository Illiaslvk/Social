# Social

The project represents a simplified version of social.

It operates on the principle of interactions between users through private messages, posts, and reactions to those posts.

In the beginning, users can have a list of friends and the ability to interact with other users. 

They can create their own posts, which other interested users can react to or comment on. 

Additionally, users have a profile with a list of interests, based on which they receive suggestions for potential friends who share those same interests.

Another important feature of this project is the ability for users to create groups for further communication.

Users can also report other participants for violating site rules. These complaints are reviewed by Admins, who make a decision and it stores in the database.
